# LEGO Star Wars AT-AT Model in SolidWorks

This repository contains a SolidWorks model of a small LEGO Star Wars AT-AT. The model was created as a personal project to practice and improve my CAD modeling skills using SolidWorks.

## ðŸ§± Project Overview

- **Model**: LEGO Star Wars AT-AT (small-scale)
- **Parts**: 11 unique LEGO pieces (based on real bricks)
- **Files Included**:
  - `.SLDPRT` files for each individual LEGO component
  - One `.SLDASM` file representing the full assembly

## ðŸ”§ How It Was Made

All parts in this model were reverse-engineered using physical LEGO bricks. I measured each part with vernier calipers to accurately recreate them in SolidWorks. The final assembly closely matches the physical model in both appearance and scale.

## ðŸ“· Preview

> *Coming soon: renders or screenshots of the final model inside SolidWorks.*

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This model is not affiliated with or endorsed by LEGO or Star Wars.
- All parts were created from physical measurements, not official LEGO CAD files.
- This is a one-off project and there are currently no plans to expand the repository with more models.

## ðŸ“¥ Usage

Youâ€™re welcome to download the files and explore the model in SolidWorks. These can be useful for educational or personal reference purposes.
